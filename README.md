A free, open-source resume builder with a live editor and instant PDF preview — built with Next.js, React, and Redux Toolkit. No sign-up, no watermark.

## Overview

HireReady lets you fill out a structured resume form and see a live, print-ready PDF preview update as you type. Your data is saved automatically to your browser's `localStorage`, so you can close the tab and pick up where you left off. When you're happy with the result, download it as a PDF.

## Features

- **Six resume templates** — ATS, Modern, Creative, Minimal, Executive, and Two Column. Each has a genuinely different layout (single column, sidebar, two-column), typography, spacing, and section order/arrangement — not just a recolor.
- **Live editor with instant PDF preview** — edit contact info, summary, education, experience, projects, skills, certificates, and languages, with the PDF preview panel updating on save or template change.
- **In-editor template switching** — swap templates from inside `/editor` with no page reload; the preview and download both update immediately.
- **Templates gallery** (`/templates`) — browse all templates with ATS-friendliness scores and recommended roles, open a full-size preview modal (zoom, next/previous, keyboard navigation), and select one to jump straight into the editor with it applied.
- **Auto-save** — resume data *and* the selected template are persisted to `localStorage` (debounced) and restored on your next visit, with schema validation so corrupted or stale data never crashes the app.
- **PDF export** — download your resume as a PDF, generated client-side with `@react-pdf/renderer`, matching whichever template is currently selected.
- **Resilient routing** — invalid editor tab query params fall back to a sensible default instead of crashing; unknown routes show a proper 404 page; unexpected errors are caught by React error boundaries instead of a blank screen.
- **Responsive, accessible UI** — built with Tailwind CSS, with `aria-label`s, keyboard navigation, and focus management on icon-only controls and modals.
- **Public resume sharing** — publish a resume to a beautiful, SEO-optimized public URL (`/r/<slug>`), with a custom-or-random slug, QR code, one-click social sharing, and view/download/share analytics. See [Phase 6](#phase-6-public-resume-sharing).
- **Resume import** — upload an existing PDF, DOCX, or JSON resume; the server extracts the text in memory (never stored) and AI converts it into structured, editable resume data with a confidence score, missing-field report, duplicate detection, and automatic cleanup. See [Phase 7](#phase-7-resume-import--export).
- **Multi-format export** — download any resume as PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, or JSON, all generated on demand in the browser. Full-account versioned JSON backups can be downloaded and restored (as new resumes, replace, or merge). See [Phase 7](#phase-7-resume-import--export).

- **State**: a single Redux slice (`store/slices/resumeSlice.js`) holds the resume content *and* the `selectedTemplate` id. Every field edit or template switch dispatches an action; the store is subscribed to persist both to `localStorage` on change (see [Template Architecture](#template-architecture)).
- **Rendering**: `components/Resume/Preview.js` resolves the selected template's PDF component via `templates/registry.js` (a plain code-split `import()`, not `next/dynamic`/`React.lazy`, since react-pdf's custom reconciler doesn't support Suspense), builds the document element, and feeds it to `usePDF`.
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router (`app/`) with route groups for the home page, and dedicated routes for `/editor`, `/templates`, and `/about`.

## Template Architecture

Templates live in `components/Resume/templates/`, one folder per template:

```
components/Resume/templates/
  shared/            Rendering logic reused by every template
    Header.js          Name/title/contact-links block
    SectionHeading.js   Titled section wrapper (title + underline + spacing)
    ListItem.js          Bulleted list row
    Sections.js         Summary/Education/Experience/Projects/Skills/
                         Certificates/Languages content renderers
  ATS/
    index.js           <Document>/<Page> layout + section order
    styles.js           StyleSheet.create({...}) — typography, spacing, color
  Modern/  Creative/  Minimal/  Executive/  TwoColumn/
    ...                (same index.js + styles.js shape)
  registry.js          id → code-split import() loader, with caching
```

**Separation of concerns**: a template's `index.js` only decides *layout* — which sections appear, in what order, and how they're arranged (single column vs. sidebar vs. two-column). It never re-implements *how* an experience entry or bullet list renders — that logic lives once in `shared/Sections.js` and is parameterized entirely by the `styles` object each template passes in. This is what keeps six visually distinct templates from duplicating rendering code.

### Adding a new template

1. Create `components/Resume/templates/YourTemplate/styles.js` — a `StyleSheet.create({...})` implementing the same style keys used by the existing templates (`page`, `header`, `headerName`, `sectionTitle`, `entryTitle`, `listRow`, etc. — copy an existing `styles.js` as a starting point).
2. Create `components/Resume/templates/YourTemplate/index.js` — import the shared section components from `../shared/Sections` and `../shared/Header`, and compose your layout (see `TwoColumn/index.js` for a multi-column example, or `Creative/index.js` for a sidebar example).
3. Register it in `components/Resume/templates/registry.js`'s `loaders` map.
4. Add its metadata (id, name, description, thumbnail, ATS score, recommended roles, colors, layout type) to `config/templates.js`.
5. Add a thumbnail image to `public/templates/`.

No other file needs to change — the templates page, editor switcher, and PDF preview all read from `config/templates.js` and `registry.js`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add automated tests (unit tests for reducers/utils, component/visual tests per template).
- [ ] Add a TypeScript migration path for stronger type safety.
- [ ] Add CI (lint + build) via GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Per-template color customization (using each template's `primaryColor`/`secondaryColor` as user-editable accents).
- [ ] Optional account/cloud sync for cross-device resume storage.

## Phase 3: Cloud & Auth

HireReady now supports Firebase Authentication + Firestore for multi-resume, cross-device storage, layered on top of the existing Redux/localStorage editor.

### Firebase project setup

1. Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Enable **Authentication > Sign-in method > Email/Password** and **Google**. For Google sign-in, set a support email in the provider config; no extra redirect URI setup is needed for `localhost` or a Vercel deployment domain added under Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains.
3. Create a **Firestore Database** (production mode).
4. Add a Web App (Project Settings > General > Your apps) and copy the SDK config values.
5. Deploy the security rules in `firestore.rules`: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (requires the Firebase CLI and `firebase init` to link the project), or paste the file's contents into Firestore's Rules tab in the console.
6. In Firestore, add a composite index if prompted when querying `resumes` by `ownerId` (Firestore will emit a console link the first time the query is run if one is needed).

Runs entirely on the free Spark plan — Firebase Storage is intentionally not used, since file uploads require the paid Blaze plan. Profile pictures are set via a URL field on the Account page instead of a file upload.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values from step 4 above:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

`.env.local` is git-ignored. The Firebase client SDK does not validate these at build time, so `npm run build` succeeds even with placeholder values — only actual network calls (sign up, log in, Firestore reads/writes) require a real project.

### Firestore schema

- `resumes/{resumeId}` — `{ ownerId, name, selectedTemplate, contact, summary, education, experience, projects, skills, certificates, languages, isDefault, createdAt, updatedAt }`. Documents live in a top-level collection (not nested under `users`) so ownership queries are a simple `where('ownerId', '==', uid)`.
- `resumes/{resumeId}/versions/{versionId}` — a snapshot of the resume content fields plus `savedAt`, written on autosave at most once every 2 minutes of active editing (the live document is updated on every autosave regardless).

### Security rules

See `firestore.rules` at the repo root: a resume is only readable/writable by the user whose `uid` matches its `ownerId`; the `versions` subcollection inherits the same check via a `get()` on the parent document. The Firestore service layer (`lib/resumes.js`) also checks ownership client-side before mutating, as defense in depth.

### Local dev

1. `npm install`
2. Set up `.env.local` as above (placeholders are fine for `npm run build`; a real Firebase project is required to actually sign up/log in).
3. `npm run dev`
4. Visit `/register` to create an account, then `/dashboard` to manage resumes.

The original `/editor` route (no resume id) still works as a local/anonymous scratch editor backed by `localStorage`, unchanged from Phase 1/2. The primary authenticated flow is `/dashboard` → pick or create a resume → `/editor/[resumeId]`, which persists to Firestore via a debounced autosave hook (`hooks/useAutoSave.js`) instead of localStorage.

## Phase 4: AI Resume Assistant

### OpenRouter setup

1. Get a free API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).
2. Add to `.env.local`: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-key>`. This variable is server-only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) and is only read inside `app/api/ai/*` route handlers — it never reaches the browser bundle.
3. Optionally set `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (defaults to `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`). Changing this value swaps the model used for every AI feature with no code changes.

### `lib/ai/` architecture

- `openrouter.js` — low-level client that calls the OpenRouter chat-completions endpoint with a 30s timeout (AbortController) and exponential-backoff retries (max 2) on 429/5xx.
- `prompts.js` — one prompt-builder per feature (`buildSummaryPrompt`, `buildExperiencePrompt`, etc.), each returning `{ system, user }` messages. System prompts require the model to use only user-provided information and respond with strict JSON matching a documented shape.
- `parser.js` — `parseAIResponse(rawText)` strips markdown code fences and recovers JSON from a response defensively, throwing `AIParseError` if unrecoverable.
- `validator.js` — one `validate*Response` function per feature checking the parsed JSON's shape/types, throwing `AIValidationError` on mismatch.
- `index.js` — `generateAIResponse({ feature, input })`, the single entry point every API route uses: looks up the prompt builder, calls OpenRouter, parses, validates, and returns structured data.
- `rateLimit.js` — in-memory sliding-window limiter (20 requests/minute per IP) shared by all AI routes.
- `request.js` — shared route handler (`handleAIRoute`) doing rate limiting, JSON body parsing, deep string sanitization (trim + 8000-char cap), and consistent error responses.

### API routes

`app/api/ai/{summary,experience,projects,skills,rewrite,grammar,review,cover-letter,ats,job-match}/route.js` — each a POST handler returning the validated AI JSON on success, or `{ error }` with 400 (bad input), 429 (rate limited), or 502/504 (upstream failure) on failure. These routes are intentionally unauthenticated: they only proxy prompts to OpenRouter and never touch Firestore or user data.

### UI

`components/AIAssistant/AIAssistantPanel.js` is a feature-switcher panel (lazy-loaded via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })`, matching the existing `VersionHistoryDrawer` pattern) added as a new card in `app/editor/[resumeId]/page.js`. It pulls context from Redux, calls the routes via `hooks/useAI.js`, and offers Accept/Regenerate/Copy actions per result. AI state (loading/error/last response per feature, plus a capped 20-entry history) lives in `store/slices/aiSlice.js`, registered in `store/index.js` alongside the existing `resume` reducer.

## Phase 5: ATS Optimization Platform

### `lib/ats/` engine

Deterministic, dependency-free JS modules — no AI calls, no React — that score and analyze a resume object synchronously:

- `textUtils.js` — shared text helpers (`resumeToText`, `getBullets`, `splitSkills`, syllable/sentence counting).
- `keywords.js` — `extractKeywords`, `analyzeKeywords` (matched/missing vs. a job description, overused, duplicate, unused skills, suggested industry keywords).
- `readability.js` — Flesch Reading Ease approximation.
- `grammar.js` — heuristic grammar/spelling/tone checks (repetition, punctuation, first-person pronouns, capitalization).
- `quality.js` — `analyzeBullets` (weak verbs, passive voice, length, missing numbers/impact) and `analyzeSections` (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Missing per section, with reasons).
- `score.js` — `computeAtsScore` combines the above into a weighted overall score (0-100) plus 10 section scores (header, summary, experience, projects, education, skills, certificates, formatting, keyword match, readability).
- `recruiter.js` — simulates a recruiter's first-pass skim (reading time, first impression, visual hierarchy score, missing recruiter-facing info).
- `recommendations.js` — turns analysis output into a flat, deduplicated, priority-sorted (critical/high/medium/low) suggestion list with stable ids.
- `comparison.js` — diffs two resume snapshots + their analyses (added/removed skills & keywords, section score deltas).
- `analysis.js` — the single entry point, `runAtsAnalysis(resume, jobDescription)`, composing every module above into one result object (`overall`, `grade`, `sectionScores`, `sectionStatus`, `readability`, `keywordAnalysis`, `bulletAnalysis`, `grammar`, `recruiter`, `completion`, `insights`, `recommendations`, `recommendationsByPriority`, `wordCount`, `analyzedAt`).

Job-description-specific recommendations that require reasoning beyond keyword matching (suggested skills/projects/certifications/resume changes) reuse the existing `lib/ai/` OpenRouter pipeline via the `jdInsights` feature (`app/api/ai/jd-insights/route.js`), following the same prompt-builder/validator pattern as every other AI feature — no new AI provider was introduced.

### State: `store/slices/atsSlice.js`

Holds the cached `analysis` result (keyed by a content hash of the current resume so it's only recomputed when the resume actually changes — see `hooks/useAtsAnalysis.js`), the job-description analyzer state (`jobDescription`, `jdAnalysis`, `jdInsights`), per-suggestion Accept/Reject/Complete status (`suggestionStatus`), a saved comparison baseline (`previousSnapshot`), and lightweight analytics counters (`history`, `totalAiGenerations`, `totalResumeEdits`). Registered in `store/index.js` alongside `resume`/`ai`; only the lightweight fields persist to `localStorage` (analysis/loading state recomputes fresh on load). `totalResumeEdits` is incremented by a small Redux middleware (`trackResumeEdits` in `store/index.js`) that watches for content-mutating `resume/*` actions, so `resumeSlice` itself stays unaware of ATS analytics.

### Dashboard pages

All pages below share `components/Ats/DashboardNav.js` for sub-navigation and pull data from `useAtsAnalysis()` (cached, resume-hash-gated) rather than recomputing analysis themselves:

- `/dashboard` — resume list (Overview), now with the dashboard sub-nav.
- `/dashboard/analytics` — full Resume Quality Dashboard: ATS score ring, grade, completion %, readability, grammar score, keyword coverage, recruiter impression, word count, last-analyzed timestamp, resume strength meter, section score bars + radar chart, section intelligence, missing sections, weak/strong bullets, insights, recruiter preview summary, job description analyzer, keyword intelligence, resume comparison, ATS score history / completion trend charts, and AI usage statistics.
- `/dashboard/job-match` — dedicated Job Description Analyzer UI using the existing `jobMatch` and `jdInsights` OpenRouter-backed routes (match %, matched/missing keywords, recommended skills/projects/certifications/changes).
- `/dashboard/keywords` — Keyword Dashboard (top resume keywords with a distribution chart, matched/missing keywords against the last analyzed job description, overused/duplicate keywords, unused skills, suggested industry keywords).
- `/dashboard/recruiter` — Recruiter Preview page (reading time, visual hierarchy score, first impression, important sections, missing recruiter info, recruiter/industry/ATS tips).
- `/dashboard/comparison` — Resume Comparison page (current vs. a saved baseline snapshot: added/removed skills & keywords, ATS score difference, improvement %, per-section score deltas).
- `/improvements` — Improvement Center: recommendations grouped into Critical/High/Medium/Low with per-suggestion Accept/Reject/Mark Complete, counts shown per priority filter, status persisted in Redux.

### Charts

`components/Ats/charts/*` use [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) (`AtsHistoryChart`, `CompletionTrendChart`, `SectionRadarChart`, `KeywordDistributionChart`) and are lazy-loaded per page via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` with a skeleton fallback (`components/Ats/Skeleton.js`), since chart rendering only makes sense client-side and shouldn't block the initial page load.

### Performance

`useAtsAnalysis` hashes the resume object and only re-runs `runAtsAnalysis` when the content actually changes, caching the result in Redux so every dashboard page reads the same cached analysis instead of recomputing it. Expensive list-rendering subcomponents (section score bars, section intelligence list, suggestion rows) are wrapped in `React.memo`.

## Phase 6: Public Resume Sharing

Users can publish a resume to a public, recruiter-friendly URL (`/r/<slug>`) without exposing any editing controls, backed entirely by Firestore — no Firebase Storage, no server-persisted PDFs or QR images.

### Firestore schema additions

Sharing metadata is stored directly on the existing `resumes/{id}` document (no new top-level fields elsewhere in the app's schema were touched):

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isPublic` | boolean | Whether the resume is currently shareable. Flipping this to `false` makes the link inaccessible immediately (checked on every read). |
| `slug` | string \| null | The currently active public slug (random or custom). |
| `customSlug` | string \| null | Set only when the active slug was chosen by the user; `null` when it's an auto-generated random slug. Lets the UI distinguish "your custom URL" from a random one. |
| `viewCount`, `downloadCount`, `shareCount` | number | Atomic counters (`increment()`), bumped by the public API routes below. |
| `lastViewed` | Timestamp | Set on every view. |
| `createdPublicAt` | Timestamp | Set the first time a resume is published; preserved across unpublish/republish. |
| `updatedPublicAt` | Timestamp | Bumped on every sharing-related change (publish, unpublish, slug change, analytics event). |

A second top-level collection, `publicSlugs/{slug} -> { resumeId, ownerId, createdAt }`, maps a slug to its resume. Slugs are **not** looked up by querying `resumes` — this mapping collection, readable only by exact document id (never listed), is what makes slugs unguessable-by-enumeration (see Security, below). A `resumes/{id}/visitors/{hashedVisitorId}` subcollection holds one marker document per unique daily visitor (hashed IP, never stored raw) so unique-visitor counts can be computed with a `getCountFromServer()` aggregation query without ballooning the parent document.

### Slug generation & validation (`lib/publicResumes.js`)

- **Random slugs**: 8 characters from a 62-character alphabet (`randomSlug()`), generated with `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues` — the Web Crypto API is available natively in both the browser and modern Node, so no extra dependency (e.g. `nanoid`) was needed. ~47.6 bits of entropy per slug.
- **Custom slugs**: `validateCustomSlug()` enforces lowercase letters, numbers, and single hyphens (`^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`), 3-40 characters, and rejects a reserved-word list (`RESERVED_SLUGS`) so a custom slug can never shadow an existing app route like `/dashboard` or `/api`.
- **Collision handling**: `setCustomSlug()` checks availability before committing and **silently falls back to a fresh random slug** if the desired one is taken (rather than failing the request) — the caller gets back `{ slug, isCustom, requested }` so the UI can toast the outcome either way.
- **Publish/unpublish/regenerate**: `publishResume`, `unpublishResume`, and `regenerateSlug` all use a Firestore `writeBatch` to keep the `publicSlugs` mapping and the `resumes` document's sharing fields consistent in one atomic write.

### Public sharing architecture

```
Dashboard card (SharePanel) ─┐
                              ├─► lib/publicResumes.js ─► Firestore (resumes + publicSlugs, client SDK, owner-authenticated)
ShareDialog (owner + visitor)┘

Visitor's browser ─► /r/[slug] (Server Component)
                        │  resolvePublicResumeBySlug(slug) — React cache()-deduped Firestore read
                        ├─► PublicResumeView (pure HTML/Tailwind resume layout, print-ready)
                        ├─► PublicResumeActions (client island: Download PDF, Print, Share)
                        └─► ViewTracker (client island) ─► POST /api/public/view ─┐
                                                            POST /api/public/download │─► lib/publicResumes.js write helpers
                                                            POST /api/public/share ───┘   (rate-limited, IP-hashed)
```

- **No Firebase Storage anywhere.** QR codes are generated client-side into an in-memory `data:` URL via the `qrcode` package (`components/Share/QRCodeBlock.js`, lazy-loaded with `next/dynamic`) and never uploaded. PDFs are generated on-demand in the visitor's browser by reusing the exact same template components as the authenticated editor (`components/Resume/templates/registry.js` + `@react-pdf/renderer`'s `pdf().toBlob()`) — the same PDF engine, zero duplication, and no server-side file storage.
- **Public page rendering** (`components/Resume/PublicResumeView.js`) is a brand-new, template-agnostic HTML layout (not one of the six PDF templates, which are react-pdf-only components that can't render to the DOM) — responsive, print-friendly via Tailwind `print:` variants, and built from the same resume fields as the editor (contact, summary, experience, projects, education, skills, certificates, languages). The resume data model has no "achievements" field (see `config/ResumeFields.js`), so that section from the original spec is intentionally omitted rather than inventing a new field across the editor, Redux slice, and all six PDF templates.
- The global `Header` (rendered by the root layout on every route) is suppressed on `/r/*` via a single pathname check, so the public page has zero dashboard/editor navigation — a clean, standalone surface.

### Analytics (`lib/publicResumes.js` + `/api/public/*`)

`viewCount`/`downloadCount`/`shareCount` are incremented atomically via Firestore's `increment()`; `lastViewed` and unique-visitor markers are written alongside. Reads are owner-only (`getPublicAnalytics`) and surfaced in the dashboard through `components/Share/AnalyticsPanel.js` (Views, Unique Visitors, Downloads, Shares, Last Viewed). All writes happen server-side through `app/api/public/{view,download,share}/route.js`, reusing the same in-memory sliding-window rate limiter already used by the AI routes (`lib/ai/rateLimit.js`), keyed per IP per endpoint.

### Security

- **No enumeration**: slugs are resolved via `publicSlugs/{slug}` — Firestore security rules grant `get` (single document, exact id) but never `list` on that collection, and the same applies to `resumes` for anonymous readers. There is no query path that can list public resumes or slugs.
- **Instant privacy**: `resolvePublicResumeBySlug` re-checks `isPublic` on every request (no caching of that decision across requests), and the Firestore rule mirrors it (`allow get: if resource.data.isPublic == true`) — disabling sharing revokes access on the very next read.
- **Field-scoped public writes**: anonymous visitors can only ever update `viewCount`, `downloadCount`, `shareCount`, `lastViewed`, `updatedPublicAt` on a published resume (enforced via `diff().affectedKeys().hasOnly([...])` in `firestore.rules`) — content, ownership, `isPublic`, and slug fields stay owner-only.
- **Ownership**: every mutation in `lib/publicResumes.js` (publish, unpublish, regenerate, custom slug) re-fetches the resume and asserts `ownerId === uid` before writing, on top of the Firestore rules doing the same server-side.
- **Rate limiting**: all three `/api/public/*` routes are rate-limited per IP (reusing `lib/ai/rateLimit.js`), and unique-visitor hashing (`sha256(salt:resumeId:ip:day)`) means raw IP addresses are never persisted.
- **No editing surface**: the public page is built from `PublicResumeView` (a read-only presentational component) and two small client islands (`PublicResumeActions`, `ViewTracker`) — there is no code path on `/r/[slug]` that can mutate resume content.
- **404s**: an invalid or private slug renders `app/r/[slug]/not-found.js` with a `noindex` meta tag. *Known limitation*: because this route is the app's first true async Server Component with data-dependent `notFound()`, and the root `app/loading.js` provides an automatic streaming fallback, the raw HTTP status for that response is `200` rather than `404` (the visible content and SEO `noindex` tag are correct either way) — see Remaining Work.

### SEO (`app/r/[slug]/page.js`)

`generateMetadata` builds a dynamic title/description from the resume's contact/summary fields, a canonical URL and Open Graph/Twitter Card metadata (using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`), and the page body embeds JSON-LD `Person` structured data (name, job title, `sameAs` social links). The resume fetch is wrapped in React's `cache()` so `generateMetadata` and the page component share a single Firestore read per request instead of two.

### Environment variable

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (see `.env.example`) — the public base URL used to build absolute share links and SEO metadata; defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if unset.

## Phase 7: Resume Import & Export

A complete import/export system: bring existing resumes into the builder with AI parsing, and take any resume out in five formats — plus full backup & restore. No file is ever stored: uploads are processed in request memory on the server and discarded; exports are generated in the browser and downloaded directly.

### Import (`/dashboard/import`)

**Supported formats**: PDF, DOCX, and JSON (single-resume exports, full HireReady backups, and [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org)-style files).

Flow:

1. **Upload** — drag & drop or browse (`react-dropzone`), with a real upload progress bar, client-side size/type pre-checks, and clear error messages.
2. **Extract** (`POST /api/import/extract`) — the server validates the upload (size cap, MIME type, magic bytes) and extracts plain text with `pdfjs-dist` (legacy build, lazy-loaded) or `mammoth`, entirely in memory. Extracted text is sanitized (control/bidi/zero-width characters stripped, length-capped). JSON files never hit this route — they are parsed in the browser.
3. **AI parse** (`POST /api/import/parse`) — the existing OpenRouter integration (`lib/ai/`) converts the text into the app's exact resume schema via a `resumeImport` prompt/validator pair, returning the parsed resume plus a **confidence score**, **missing fields**, and **suggestions**. Results are memoized server-side by text hash (10-minute TTL).
4. **AI cleanup** (`POST /api/import/cleanup`, runs automatically) — fixes grammar, normalizes dates to `YYYY-MM`, normalizes bullet points, detects skills demonstrated but not listed, and recommends ATS improvements — without changing facts. Can be re-run manually; failures never block the import.
5. **Review** — original extracted text side-by-side with the fully editable parsed resume (every section, add/remove entries), plus the confidence/missing-fields/suggestions panels.
6. **Duplicate detection** — on save, the import is compared against your existing resumes (name/email match, per-entry experience/project/education similarity via token overlap, skill-list overlap). If a likely duplicate is found you choose **Merge** (union of entries + skills; existing content wins conflicts), **Replace** (a version snapshot is saved first so it's undoable), or **Keep Both**.

Key modules: `lib/import/validation.js` (shared client/server validation + sanitization), `lib/import/extract.js` (server-only text extraction), `lib/import/normalize.js` (coerces any parsed/imported shape into the app schema), `lib/importExport/duplicates.js` (detection + merging), `components/ImportExport/*` (dropzone, review editor, duplicate resolver).

### Export (`/dashboard/export`)

Pick any resume and export it as:

| Format | How it's generated |
| --- | --- |
| **PDF** | The existing `@react-pdf/renderer` template engine — identical output to the editor preview, lazy-loaded |
| **DOCX** | The `docx` package (headings, tab-aligned dates, bullet lists), lazy-loaded |
| **HTML** | Self-contained, print-friendly document with all values HTML-escaped |
| **Markdown** | Clean single-document markdown |
| **JSON** | Portable single-resume backup (re-importable) |

All files are generated in the browser on demand (`lib/importExport/exporters/`) and downloaded via an object URL — nothing is uploaded or stored.

### Backup & Restore (`/dashboard/export`)

- **Backup** — one click downloads a versioned JSON file (`format: "hireready-backup"`, `version: 1`, export timestamp) containing every resume's content and template choice, with Firestore metadata/sharing state stripped.
- **Restore** — upload a backup and choose: **restore as new resumes**, **replace** the selected resume, or **merge** into it. Replace/merge save a version snapshot first, so both are reversible from the editor's Version History.

### Import History (`/dashboard/history`)

Every import attempt (including failures and backup restores) is logged to a new owner-scoped `importHistory` Firestore collection: file name, date, source format, status, parse success, confidence, and a link to the created resume. Entries can be deleted; history writes are best-effort and never block an import.

### Security

- **Never stored** — uploads live only in the request's memory; no Firebase Storage, no disk, no bucket.
- **Magic-byte validation** — the declared MIME type is not trusted; PDF (`%PDF-`) and DOCX (`PK` zip) headers are verified server-side, so renamed/corrupted files are rejected with specific errors (413/415/422).
- **5 MB upload cap**, enforced client-side, via `Content-Length`, and on the actual bytes.
- **Text sanitization** — control characters, bidi overrides, and zero-width characters (prompt-injection/spoofing vectors) are stripped before the text reaches the AI or the browser; the import prompt also instructs the model to treat file content strictly as data.
- **Rate limiting** — extract/parse/cleanup routes have per-IP sliding-window limits (10/6/6 per minute), reusing `lib/ai/rateLimit.js`.
- **Firestore rules** — `importHistory` documents are readable/deletable only by their owner and immutable once created.

### Firestore schema addition

```
importHistory/{entryId}
  ownerId, fileName, source ('pdf'|'docx'|'json'|'backup'),
  status ('success'|'failed'), parseSuccess, confidence,
  resumeId, resumeName, error, importedAt
```

## Deployment

The app is a standard Next.js project and deploys cleanly to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (recommended) or any Node.js host that supports `next build` / `next start`. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard (the latter should be your production domain, e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`, so share links and SEO metadata resolve correctly). Deploy the updated `firestore.rules` (Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules, or `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`) before shipping Phase 6/7 — public sharing and import history depend on it. Phase 7 also requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (already needed since Phase 4) for AI resume parsing. The Google Analytics ID is currently hardcoded in `app/layout.js`.
